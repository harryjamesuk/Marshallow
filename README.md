# Marshallow

Just practicing android new Marshallow runtime permission.

This app has a floating button with camera icon.When a user tap on a item it take photo and store that photo in external storage.
But when the user tap on the buttton it ask user to give access to external storage.

That's it.

It is called runtime permission.
